		"remarks": "(Name) and the entire staff at (Dr.Pro HealthCare) are beyond amazing. When you have an appointment, they will spend the whole scheduled period with you if need be; I know when I come in to see Dr. Zachary Shelton, he’s already reviewed the reasons for my coming in and my file. I never feel rushed, and he always asks if I have any other questions. He’s awesome. Also, when he knew my medication was expensive on my insurance, he looked up what competing pharmacies charged with GoodRX and printed me out the prices – saved me lots!"
